# cmdclip 📋

> A lightweight, offline-first, cross-platform clipboard manager with LAN Sync and secure secret tracking.
> Built with Flutter and Material 3 — GPL-3.0 License.

**cmdclip** is a modern, high-performance clipboard manager designed to run natively on **Windows**, **Linux**, and **Android** from a single codebase. It is 100% offline, requires no cloud accounts, no internet, and has absolutely zero telemetry.

## 🚀 Key Features

1. **Clipboard History** — Polling-based background tracking captures everything you copy with accurate timestamps.
2. **Pinning & Categories** — Organizes clips instantly. Pin important snippets to keep them at the top, or assign entries to custom user-defined categories (e.g., *Work*, *Terminal*, *Code*, *Personal*).
3. **Secure Secret Mode** — One-tap toggle disables history recording. Copies during Secret Mode trigger a secure countdown timer that automatically overwrites/clears your system clipboard after a user-defined timeout (e.g., 30s, 60s).
4. **Command Templates** — Supports placeholders like `ssh {user}@{host} -p {port=22}`. Prompts with a sleek, interactive input form to resolve variables, pre-filling defaults before copying the finalized command.
5. **Regex Search** — Seamless regular expression search across your history with an easy toggle button.
6. **Local LAN Sync** — Real-time clipboard sharing between desktops and Android over your local Wi-Fi network. Acts as both an HTTP server and a UDP client to perform auto-discovery and direct paired synchronization. No internet, cloud, or accounts required!
7. **JSON & CSV Export/Import** — Easily back up, share, or migration-import history. Hand-written custom CSV state machine parser handles multi-line cells and quotes cleanly.
